# LED Circuit Cont.

We saw how changing the resistor resulted in a different brightness of LED.  Now let's replace the resistor and add a `variable resistor` (aka `potentiometer`)

**TODO picture of breadboard with varistor**

Notice how the brightness of the LED changes as you turn the `potentiometer` and then suddenly turns off.  Why do you think that is?

Let's use our `oscilloscope` to understand what's going on.  An `oscilloscope` takes electrical measurements over time and continuously displays them.

We're using the `oscilloscope` to measure the `voltage` on the LED.  You can think of `voltage` as electrical pressure similar to water pressure from a hose.  Turning the `potentiometer` increases or decreases that pressure.

At what voltage does the LED turn off? We'll revisit this topic in a few chapters.
