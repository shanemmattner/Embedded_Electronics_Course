  - 4.4 Compare digital vs hardware filter
    - Talk about how adding hardware components adds cost, complexity, and failure modes
    - Talk about trade-offs with software filter
- Intro to sensors (ADC)
  - 5.1 Introduce temperature sensor
    - What is it used for?  
  - 5.2 Walk through hardware circuit
  - 5.3 Walk through software
- More involved ADC
  - 6.1 Create analog "lock" with multiple potentiometers
    - Turning the dials to correct range results in printing message
  - 6.2 Programming becomes more involved
    - Functions and loops to poll all the ADC's
- I2C sensor
  - 7.1 Demonstration code talking with TOF sensor
  - 7.2 Programming DAC to output voltage and change intensity of LED
  - 7.3 Briefly talk about communications protocols
    - ie I2C is kinda like USB
    - The common comms protocols in embedded: i2c, spi, uart, 
    - UART is what we are using to talk with the ESP32
  - 7.4 Put oscilloscope (logic analyzer?) on signal lines to show what's going on
- SPI flash storage
  - 8.1 Explain how data is lost on power-off
  - 8.2 Demonstrate basic read/write to FLASH
  - 8.3 Make program that does something on boot
    - First independent program
    - Use all previous components
      - Button press turns on LED that tells the user to input a combo, then press button again to submit
      - Correct user input unlocks access to LED controlled by TOF sensor
- Make a simple PCB that plugs into ESP32 dev kit
  - 9.1 What is a PCB?  Why do we need it?
    - We've prototyped a design on a breadboard and now it's time to make it
    - More robust than a breadboard w/ wires and parts sticking out
  - 9.2 Create a schematic
  - 9.3 Create the PCB
  - 9.4 Generate gerbers
  - 9.5 Upload to PCBway and order
    - Optional but encouraged
- While we wait for board to come in let's cover some programming practices
  - 10.1 Intro to state machines
    - Allows us to break problems down into small parts
    - Easily build complex programs with independent logic
  - 10.2 Create state machine for "magic" LED
    - 1. Locked
    - 2. Unlocked
  - 10.3 Create state-machine for lock/unlock logic
    - 1. Wait for button press
    - 2. User enters some value for each potentiometer
    - 3. Wait for button press
    - 4. Read ADC's
    - 5. Read code from Flash memory
    - 6. Compare codes
    - 7. Lock/unlock access to "magic" LED
- Let's save the code we've been developing
  - 11.1 Introduction to version control and GIT
  - 11.2 Create a repository and upload to Github
- We'd also like the user to have an option to input the code on a key-pad
  - PCB is already being fabricated though so we have to find another solution
  - 12.1 Intro to capacitive touch buttons
    - Include a little more lesson on capacitors and time constants?
  - 12.2 Impement solution with polling
  - 12.3 Introduction to interrupts?
  - From this point we should give the students the option to use capacitive buttons or physical buttons in their projects
    - Good way to introduce the concept of design decisions
- Documenting the design
  - 13.1 Introduction to draw.io for documenting firmware
  - 13.2 Intro to Google Slides
    - Snippets of circuits and associated signals
    - Discussion of trade-offs
- Assume we've received PCB by now and we need to test
  - 14.1 Visually inspecting the PCB
  - 14.2 Start Google Slides presentation to record inspection
  - 14.3 Cautiously testing one part at a time
    - 1. Don't plug in dev kit yet, jumper voltage from dev board to 3.3v rail
      - Measure voltage of rails to make sure there's no short
    - 2. Sweep potentiometers
    - 3. Send I2C & SPI commands, confirm chips respond
  - 14.4 Collect signals from testing
    - Export as CSV's
- Basic data analysis and presentation
  - 15.1 Import CSV's
  - 15.2 Plot with Pandas
  - 15.3 Look at edges and transients of signal
    - I2C and SPI signal waveforms look good?
-
