# Ideas for this class:

- TOF sensor as a novel "button" or input
- System that will take some action based on a light sensor?  Put it by a window and do something
- Teach initial programming with micro-Python
  - Move to C based programming after students are comfortable with electronics
- Use [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/tutorials/building-circuit) to make clean circuits on breadboards that students can follow
- Paper cutout that labels the pins of the dev board like this:
