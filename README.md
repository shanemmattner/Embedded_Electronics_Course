# Embedded Electronics Course

This course will guide you through learning about the world of electronics and embedded systems.  We'll do this in a practical way that introduces circuits and programming as we need them to ease our way into the vast ocean that is embedded systems.

## 1: LED circuit

Let's make one of the most basic circuits in electronics.  But first:  **what is a circuit?**

A `circuit` is a just a bunch of electronic components connected by wires.  We'll use **3** electronic components for this LED circuit:
- LED: component that emits light when electricity is applied
- Resistor: component that limits the amount of electricity that can flow
- Voltage supply:  the source of electricity
