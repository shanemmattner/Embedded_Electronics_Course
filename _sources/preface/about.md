# About

This class is designed to teach someone that knows nothing about electronics to build their own circuit boards and become proficient and programming micro-controllers.  

## Who am I?

My name is Shane Mattner and I'm an embedded firmware and hardware engineer.  I got my associates in Wind Energy Technology and then a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering Technology.  

I started off my career in industrial automation as a service technician.  But then I happened along embedded electronics and fell in love.  Eventually, I tried to start my own business making industrial motor controllers.  That failed miserably but I learned a lot and got a real embedded engineering job as a result.  Since then I've had a few different positions and learned a lot of interesting lessons about embedded systems.

I've always loved education and learning. The first class that taught me about embedded systems was a free online MOOC on edX.  Since then I've taken dozens of classes on Udemy and other platforms.  One of my favorite hobbies is scouring the internet for the best technical resources to learn awesome engineering.

As for my teaching credentials: I taught a night class about Industrial Electrical concepts at Gateway Technical College in my home town of Kenosha, WI.  I'm also currently helping to develop the cirriculum for University of British Columbia's class on data exploration using [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)

Currently, I'm living the dream of working for a start-up in Silicon Valley.
