# Intro
This book is a **hands-on and practical** guide through the basics of `electronics` and `embedded systems`.  We'll build a real system and get a professional quality `circuit board` made with your own design.

First we learn about basic electronics by putting together an `LED circuit`.  Then we'll use `test equipment` to experiment on our LED circuit.

After we get a handle on electronics we'll make the system intelligent by programming a tiny computer called a `micro-controller`.  We'll see how the LED circuit can be used with the `micro-controller` in a useful way.

Some equipment is required but I chose the cheapest possible.  In the future I plan to sell pre-packaged parts to get started quickly and easily.
