# Intro

I love the world of electronics and embedded systems.  This book is my attempt to write down all the lessons I've learned both for myself and to pass on the incredible knowledge I have been gifted.

The guiding theory of this book is **hands-on and practical** at all times.  Theory will be taught after we explore the topic and can intuite some of what's going on.  There will be math, but always with a reason and always to do something cool.

We'll start by putting some electronic parts together and exploring the basics of electricity.  Then we'll move into making our own circuit boards! From this point on we'll use all the lessons we learn to add to a real circuit board that we will get manufactured!

To make embedded electronics we need special equipment.  For this class I chose the cheapest and most effective multi-tool I could find:  

Then we'll learn about the basics of programming and what an **embedded system** actually is.  Programming `embedded systems` is much different than programming websites, databases, or other types of software.  It's much more practical and (I think) easier to grasp.

After we have a working embedded system we'll try to make that system useful by putting some sensors on it.  We'll measure the temperature and humidity.  We can measure how far our hand is from the circuit board.
