# 1.2 LED Circuit Cont.

We saw how changing the resistor resulted in a different brightness of LED.  Now let's add a `variable resistor` to the circuit which will allow us to test many different values quickly. </br></br>

The `variable resistor` has 3 legs:

## Lab

### Part 1

Replace the <span style="color:brown">**brown**</span> resistor with the <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span> resistor.  Then add the `variable resistor` into the circuit.  The blue resistor leg goes into the row with the top pin of the `variable resistor` and the LED leg goes into the row with the middle pin

Notice how the brightness of the LED changes as you turn the `potentiometer`.

### Part 2

Open the `Labador Espotek` software

We're using the `oscilloscope` to measure the `voltage` on the LED.  You can think of `voltage` as electrical pressure similar to water pressure from a hose.  Turning the `potentiometer` increases or decreases that pressure.

At what voltage does the LED turn off? We'll revisit this topic in a few chapters.
